- Python, Flask, RESTful
- Web-crawled over 1GB parking data, parsed raw data format and integrated different data source to generate
500,000+ parking signs entries in standard format.
- Built a REST API GET to retrieve nearby parking signs provided user location or searched address.
- Built a demo website with Python Flask displaying data on Google Maps: http://nyc-parking.herokuapp.com
